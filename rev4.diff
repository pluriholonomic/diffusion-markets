+\subsection{Beyond Brier and log: general proper scoring rules}\label{sec:psr-general}
+
+Theorem~\ref{thm:proper-regret} already shows that, for binary outcomes, \emph{every} strictly proper scoring rule induces a Bregman divergence through its Bayes risk.
+An analogous representation holds on any finite outcome space: (regular) strictly proper scoring rules are in one-to-one correspondence with strictly convex ``entropy'' functions on the probability simplex, and \emph{expected scoring regret equals the associated Bregman divergence} \cite{gneiting2007strictly,ovcharov2018bregman}.
+
+Concretely, let $\Delta_m:=\{p\in\R_{\ge 0}^m:\sum_{i=1}^m p_i=1\}$.
+Let $\Phi:\Delta_m\to\R$ be differentiable and strictly convex.
+Define the score (higher is better)
+\[
+S_\Phi(q,y)\ :=\ \Phi(q)+\inner{\nabla\Phi(q)}{e_y-q},
+\]
+and the corresponding loss $\ell_\Phi(q,y):=-S_\Phi(q,y)$.
+Then $\ell_\Phi$ is strictly proper, and for any true $p\in\Delta_m$,
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:psr-bregman}
+\E_{y\sim p}\big[\ell_\Phi(q,y)-\ell_\Phi(p,y)\big]\;=\;D_\Phi(p,q),
+\end{equation}
+where $D_\Phi$ is the Bregman divergence generated by $\Phi$.
+Thus, in principle, \emph{any} strictly convex potential $\Phi$ (with mild regularity) yields a valid proper scoring rule whose regret geometry is Bregman.%
+\footnote{More generally, proper \emph{affine} scoring rules correspond to convex $\Phi$ with (possibly set-valued) subgradients; see \cite{ovcharov2018bregman}.}
+
+\paragraph{Why we focus on Brier and log.}
+Brier and log loss are canonical because they correspond to two widely used market objectives: squared error calibration (Brier) and multiplicative wealth / Kelly growth (log).
+However, most of our arguments---in particular, the reduction from ``predictive error'' to ``economic exploitability''---only rely on \eqref{eq:psr-bregman} and on basic curvature properties of $D_\Phi$.
+This makes it straightforward to generalize the regret-to-calibration and regret-to-arbitrage bounds to other proper losses (e.g.\ pseudospherical scores, Tsallis/power scores) by tracking their induced Bregman geometry \cite{gneiting2007strictly,ovcharov2018bregman}.
+
+
+\section{Proper Scoring Rules, Convex Market Makers, and CFMMs}\label{sec:amm}
+
+Proper scoring rules are not only evaluation metrics: they also induce \emph{market mechanisms}.
+This section records two well-known correspondences---(i) scoring rules $\leftrightarrow$ convex cost-function market makers, and (ii) convex market makers $\leftrightarrow$ CFMMs via convex duality---because they help interpret our calibration/arbitrage results as statements about real market microstructure.
+
+\subsection{Cost-function market makers and scoring-rule markets}
+
+In a complete $m$-outcome market, let $q\in\R^m$ denote the vector of outstanding shares of Arrow--Debreu securities (one per outcome).
+A \emph{cost-function market maker} is specified by a convex differentiable function $C:\R^m\to\R$; the instantaneous price vector is
+\[
+p(q)\ :=\ \nabla C(q)\in\Delta_m,
+\]
+and a trader who changes inventory from $q$ to $q' = q+r$ pays
+\[
+\mathrm{Pay}(q,r)\ :=\ C(q+r)-C(q).
+\]
+This framework unifies utility-based market makers, market scoring rules, and online learning potentials \cite{hanson2003msr,chenpennock2012utility,abernethy2013convexmm}.
+When $C$ is the log-partition function, $\nabla C$ recovers the LMSR prices; when $C$ is quadratic, the induced prices correspond to a Brier-like quadratic market.
+More generally, for complete markets, market scoring rules induced by proper entropies can be implemented via an equivalent convex cost function \cite{hanson2003msr,abernethy2013convexmm}.
+
+\subsection{Bregman geometry as an implicit ``curvature fee''}
+
+A key identity is that the cost-function payment decomposes into an instantaneous linear price term plus a Bregman divergence:
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:cost-bregman}
+C(q+r)-C(q)\;=\;\inner{\nabla C(q)}{r}\;+\;D_C(q+r,q),
+\end{equation}
+where $D_C$ is the Bregman divergence generated by $C$.
+The term $D_C(q+r,q)$ can be interpreted as an \emph{implicit fee} (or curvature charge) that compensates the market maker for taking inventory risk on large trades.
+This viewpoint makes the connection to Section~\ref{sec:psr-general} concrete: convex potentials simultaneously induce (i) proper scoring rules whose regret is Bregman and (ii) market makers whose payments include a Bregman ``fee'' \cite{abernethy2013convexmm,ovcharov2018bregman}.
+
+\subsection{Constant function market makers (CFMMs) and convex duality}
+
+Decentralized exchanges and some on-chain prediction-market designs use \emph{constant function market makers} (CFMMs), which maintain reserves $R\in\R_{\ge 0}^d$ and accept trades that preserve a trading function (or equivalently, keep reserves within a convex feasible set).
+Angeris et al.\ show that many CFMMs admit a clean convex-optimization formulation for multi-asset trades, with prices given by Lagrange multipliers/duals \cite{angeris2021cfmm}.
+Angeris and Chitra analyze CFMMs as a broad class of automated market makers and study their price-oracle properties under arbitrage \cite{angeris2020oracles}.
+
+While CFMMs are not identical to cost-function prediction markets, both families are governed by convex analysis.
+In particular, the \emph{value function} of a CFMM liquidity provider is concave, monotone, and 1-homogeneous in a suitable numeraire, and its convex-analytic dual objects control marginal prices and slippage \cite{angeris2021cfmm,angeris2020oracles}.
+
+\subsection{Replication and replicating market makers}
+
+Classical no-arbitrage pricing in mathematical finance is often presented via \emph{replication}: in complete markets, any contingent claim can be replicated by a self-financing portfolio, yielding a unique arbitrage-free price.
+In prediction markets, each Arrow--Debreu security is itself a contingent claim; hence ``replication'' of the terminal payoff is trivial.
+However, replication ideas reappear at the \emph{market-maker level}: replicating market makers construct CFMMs whose \emph{portfolio value function} matches a desired payoff profile, and show an equivalence between concave 1-homogeneous payoff functions and convex CFMM trading sets \cite{angeris2021replicating}.
+This provides a microstructure-level replication lens complementary to our \emph{forecasting-level} lens: we bound the expected profits of statistical-arbitrage strategies against a posted price function $q(x)$ without assuming any particular replication structure or price process.

 The trader's \emph{linear} profit is $\Pi_t=b_t(Y_t-q_t)$.
 With proportional transaction cost $c\ge 0$, profit is $\Pi_t=b_t(Y_t-q_t)-c|b_t|$.
 
+\subsection{Price-dependent transaction fees}\label{sec:txfees}
+
+Real prediction markets impose execution frictions through explicit fees (commissions), bid--ask spreads, and (for on-chain venues) network gas costs.
+To keep the theory prior-independent and microstructure-agnostic, we use a minimal \emph{price-dependent fee} model that subsumes several deployed fee schedules.
+
+\begin{definition}[Price-dependent fee model]\label{def:fee-model}
+Fix a nonnegative function $\tau:(0,1)\to\R_{\ge 0}$ (a per-share fee as a function of the executed price) and an optional fixed overhead $g\ge 0$ (per trade).
+Given posted price $q_t$, a trade of size $b_t\in[-B,B]$ yields profit
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:profit-fee}
+\Pi_t^{(\tau,g)} \ :=\ b_t(Y_t-q_t)\;-\;\tau(q_t)\,|b_t|\;-\;g\,\1\{b_t\neq 0\}.
+\end{equation}
+When $\tau\equiv c$ and $g=0$, this reduces to proportional transaction cost $c$.
+\end{definition}
+
+The next theorem shows that, for the \emph{maximal} class of bounded measurable trading rules $b(x,q)\in[-B,B]$, the best achievable expected profit is a simple thresholding functional of the mispricing magnitude and the fee schedule.
+
+\begin{theorem}[Fee-adjusted bounded statistical arbitrage]\label{thm:fee-arb}
+Let $f(x)=\Prob(Y=1\mid X=x)$ and let $q:\cX\to(0,1)$ be a posted price function.
+Let $\cB_{\mathrm{all}}:=\{b:\cX\times(0,1)\to[-B,B]\ \text{measurable}\}$ be the class of all bounded (possibly randomized) trading rules that depend on $(x,q(x))$ only.
+Then for any horizon $T$,
+\begin{equation}\label{eq:fee-arb-exact}
+\mathrm{ArbReg}^{(\tau,g)}_T(q;\cB_{\mathrm{all}})
+\;=\;
+T\cdot \E\Big[\,B\cdot\big(|f(X)-q(X)|-\tau(q(X))-\tfrac{g}{B}\big)_+\,\Big].
+\end{equation}
+In particular, when $g=0$,
+\[
+\mathrm{ArbReg}^{(\tau,0)}_T(q;\cB_{\mathrm{all}})
+\;=\;
+T\cdot \E\Big[\,B\cdot\big(|f(X)-q(X)|-\tau(q(X))\big)_+\,\Big].
+\]
+\end{theorem}
+
+\begin{remark}[Prior-independence and comparison to calibration]\label{rem:fees-prior}
+The expression \eqref{eq:fee-arb-exact} is \emph{prior-independent} in the sense that it depends only on the joint law of $(X,Y)$ through the conditional mean $f(X)$ and the posted price $q(X)$; it does not assume any particular dynamics for $q_t$ (order books, AMMs, inventory constraints, etc.).
+It also makes clear that fees introduce a \emph{margin}: mispricing must exceed $\tau(q)+g/B$ to support positive expected profit for bounded statistical arbitrage.
+Conservative robust-calibration bounds such as \cref{thm:cal-noarb} can be recovered by lower-bounding $\tau(q)$ by a constant fee floor.
+\end{remark}
+
+\begin{remark}[Example fee schedules: Kalshi and Polymarket]\label{rem:fees-real}
+Kalshi publicly specifies a taker fee charged as a percentage of ``expected earnings.'' In its October 2025 fee schedule, for a trade of $C$ contracts at price $P\in(0,1)$ dollars, the fee is
+$\mathrm{fee}=\lceil 0.07\cdot C\cdot P(1-P)\rceil$ dollars (rounded up to the next cent), and the corresponding maker fee (when applicable) uses coefficient $0.0175$ \cite{kalshiFeeSchedule2025}.
+A minimal model compatible with \cref{def:fee-model} is therefore to set
+\[
+\tau_{\mathrm{Kalshi}}(P)=0.07\,P(1-P)\quad\text{(taker)}\qquad\text{or}\qquad
+\tau_{\mathrm{Kalshi}}^{\mathrm{maker}}(P)=0.0175\,P(1-P)\quad\text{(maker)},
+\]
+and to include a fixed overhead $g\le 0.01$ dollars per trade to capture the cent-rounding (since $\lceil x\rceil = x+\delta$ with $\delta\in[0,0.01)$).%
+\footnote{Kalshi also lists product-specific coefficients (e.g.\ $0.035$ for INX/NASDAQ100 markets).} \cite{kalshiFeeSchedule2025}
+
+Polymarket's documentation states that it does not charge trading fees for shares in its markets \cite{polymarketFees2025}; a minimal model is $\tau\equiv 0$ with an overhead $g$ capturing network gas costs (and, if desired, a spread/slippage term).
+For Polymarket~US, a published schedule charges a taker fee equal to $1$ basis point ($0.01\%$) of the total contract premium, with a minimum fee of $1$ basis point ($0.0001$) per trade \cite{polymarketUSFees2025}.
+This is compatible with $\tau_{\mathrm{PMUS}}(P)\approx 10^{-4}P$ and $g\approx 10^{-4}$ in \cref{def:fee-model}.

+\begin{proof}
+Fix $x\in\cX$ and abbreviate $q=q(x)$, $a=f(x)-q$, and $t=\tau(q)$.

+If $a\ge 0$, then for $b\ge 0$ the objective equals $b(a-t)-g$ (for $b>0$) and is maximized by $b=B$ when $a-t>g/B$, otherwise by $b=0$; for $b\le 0$ the objective is at most $0$.
+If $a<0$, the symmetric argument shows the maximizer is $b=-B$ when $|a|-t>g/B$, otherwise $b=0$.

+\[
+B\big(|a|-t-\tfrac{g}{B}\big)_+ \;=\; B\big(|f(x)-q(x)|-\tau(q(x))-\tfrac{g}{B}\big)_+.

+Randomization does not improve the optimum because the objective is concave piecewise-linear in $b$ and the feasible set is an interval.
